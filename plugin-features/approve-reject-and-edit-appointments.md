# Approve, Reject, Edit, and Delete appointments

In the **Actions** column, you can find three options you can use: **Approve**, **Reject**, **Edit, Delete**.

**Approve** confirms the appointment, **Reject** cancels the appointment, **Edit** allows you to change the arrangement details, and **Delete** allows you to delete appointment(s).

Depending on the action taken — **Approve** or **Rejecte** — the appointment status will be changed automatically to **Approved** or **Canceled**.
